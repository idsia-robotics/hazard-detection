# Hazard Detection
This is the main repository for the dataset Dataset for Sensing Anomalies as Potential Hazards in Mobile Robots.
The dataset can be find on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/record/5520933

<!-- The relative video is available at TODO -->


The relative papers are under review.
Under `./code` you can find the code used for the paper. We use python 3.8 and the requirements in `./code/requirementes.txt`; follow the README.md under the `./code` to install and run the models.


# Scenarios
The dataset is composed of three different scenarios:
- Tunnel
- Factory
- Corridors

In the version of the dataset of paper <PAPER1> the Corridors scenario has 52'607 samples and 8 anomalies. 
In paper <PAPER2> we extended this scenario up to 132'838 frames and 16 anomalies.

## Description
Across the three scenarios we recorded various normal situations and numerous anomalies.
The anomalies are the following:
<!-- AN1 - image - description -->

### Factory Anomalies
 Mist
 Tape
### Corridors Anomalies
